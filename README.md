# Restaurant Health Inspection Analysis

## Duval County, Florida 

William Ponton

Phase I Started: 6.1.19

### Project Description
Welcome to my analysis of Health Department Inspections for Duval County.  This project will scrape Restaurant Ispection results from the public records found on the [Tallahassee Data](https://data.tallahassee.com/) archives.  I am interested in using the findings in this analysis to locate trouble neighborhoods, chains, or operators based on the repeated violations that will be documented in these Inspection Reports.  No restaurant is perfect, so there will be minor violations in each report, however I believe that I can identify problematic operators and high risk zip codes based on analyzing the dataset I will create.

### Project Scope Outline
This project will start by creating a Dataset of the Health Inspections for Duval County, Florida scraped from the public records found [here](https://data.tallahassee.com/restaurant-inspections/duval/list/).  Once the Dataset is created it must be cleaned and normalized in to a useful form.  Next, we can begin to statistically analyze the data for patterns.  I am interested to identify any problematic chains, operators, and high risk zip codes using the results of the Inspection Reports.  Next, visualizations will be created to further communicate the results to the end users.  I plan to implement the findings in an interactive website that will allow searching and filtering based on user defined input.  Finally, I will attempt to replicate the project for other counties on the [Tallahassee Data](https://data.tallahassee.com/) archives and other states if possible.
